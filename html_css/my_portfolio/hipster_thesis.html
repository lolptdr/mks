	<p id="author">By Harsh Patel</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Hipster refers to a subcultre of young, urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the 1990s. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> is associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, progressive [1][2] or independent political views, alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism, and alternative lifestyles. Interests in media include independent film, magazines such as Clash, and websites like Pitchfork Media.

	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
		<p>
			Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]".[3] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar era: beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", and "regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity".
